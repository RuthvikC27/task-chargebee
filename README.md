# Technologies used -
1. ReactJS (Webpack)
1. Material-ui (CSS)
1. NodeJS/ExpressJS
1. Firebase database, firestore, and authentication.
1. Twilio - a message sending package.

# Backend -
### Created two api's
1. /api/auth/login - handles storing user token, email, and password after firebase createUserWithEmailAndPassword authentication.
1. /api/message/sendmessage - handles send message to user using twilio package.

# Frontend -
1. It consists of just four routes. A homepage, authentication page, landing page(after signed in) and message page(where user can send message) and also an 404 error page if url doesn't exist.
1. User can be sign up using email and password or google authentication. Also sign in by the same process.

### As time was little I could not style the entire homepage.
